Normal ahh chatbot, but the response chat will be translated to japanease and spoken by a character from voicevox which is a popular text to speech software. 
Also chatgpt will generate options to its own response while voicevox is playing the audio file. Api key to voicevox is free to get it head over to https://su-shiki.com/api/ and fill out the form. 
For chatgpt the first key should give you free trail of 5 euros worth of tokens. and deepl you just have to creat an accoun to get. 
As you can see Im bad at explaining things formaly. There is almost no comments in the code just a heads up, but feel free to check it out, and critisism is highly appreciated.
This is just the beggining of my coding journey, so if someone would like to help I would gladly thank you.
